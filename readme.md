# PR Guru
## Introduction
*PR Guru* is a kiosk mode style single page application for displaying open pull requests on a TV, in the same vein as Stalemate and Fourth Wall.

## Usage
Open the index.html file in your browser, with a fragment identfier of the organisation/repo. e.g.
```
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome file:///$PWD/index.html#bambrp/pr-guru
```
Here the fragment identifier is `#bambrp/pr-guru`, where `bambrp` is the organisation, and `pr-guru` is the repo.
